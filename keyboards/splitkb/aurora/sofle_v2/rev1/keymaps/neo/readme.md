# Aurora Sofle v2's Neo Keymap

A simple neo keymap for the Aurora Sofle v2
===============================================

My goal is to implemet the [neo2 keyboard layout](https://neo-layout.org/Layouts/neo/)
in hardware, for environments where I can not run it via software.

Since this seems to be not as easy as hard I keep it to layers 1-4
and even those may not be complete.

## Ideas

A lot of work can be copied from https://github.com/yeldiRium/qmk-neo2/ and its template  https://github.com/mjonuschat/ergodox_osx_neo2

One may also check https://github.com/blipp/qmk-neo2 

Interesting could also be [not quite neo](https://github.com/jola5/qmk_firmware/blob/not-quite-neo/users/not-quite-neo/nqn-basic-layout.h)
